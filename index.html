            <h2>Benefits of Chakrasana: Boost your confidence by learning to hone this Yoga asana</h2>
            <p>Welcome balance, positivity and confidence in your body with yoga. Learn how you yoga can help boost your
                confidence levels!
                <br>
                Yoga is known around the world as one of the most powerful tools to bring harmony to a person’s body,
                mind, and spirit. It channelises the energy inside the human body and balances the chemicals that lie
                within it. It requires efforts to hone yoga asanas to an extent that you start performing them the right
                way. However, when you work consistently and steadily, yoga can instil discipline in you. One of the
                most tedious poses is Chakrasana, but if you invest your energy in trying to master it, you’ll end up
                gaining a lot of confidence.
                <br>
                Recently, Shynee Narang, a certified yoga instructor, took to her social media to share how the process
                of honing Chakrasana is linked with boosted confidence levels. Understand how you can perform yoga for
                confidence.
                <br>
                Narang says, “Chakrasana is one such pose which was extremely difficult for me. So, I decided to do a
                lot of preparation and drills, instead of trying to achieve the pose. Slowly, my body became stronger,
                and daily practice gave me a lot of confidence. The day I did the pose for the first time, my confidence
                level increased significantly. And, it started to reflect in all spheres of my life, while talking to
                people, during negotiations, and even in my work. Earlier I used to feel powerless in a difficult
                situation, but now I have the confidence to deal with that, and it all became possible because of yoga.”
                We only face low confidence levels in life when we feel we aren’t capable enough to win in a situation.
                Similarly, yoga is one such practice in which certain asanas challenge the capabilities of our body, and
                provoke us to push our limits. Initially, it might seem intimidating, however, with time, when you start
                performing the yoga poses right, you naturally start feeling more in power, which helps raise your
                confidence.
                <br>
                Yoga is more about bringing your body, mind, and focus back to the present moment with slow but deep
                breathing as you perform. Apart from Chakrasana, other poses can also help cultivate balance and
                confidence in you.
