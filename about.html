                togetherness and mutual growth. Our annual retreat, held amidst the serene landscapes of the Himalayas,
                is particularly popular among members. Beyond yoga, we promote a lifestyle of mindfulness, encouraging
                members to incorporate sustainable practices in their daily lives. <img
